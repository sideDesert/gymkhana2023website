      Constitution and functions through its Executive Council, with the
      guidance of faculty incharges. <br><br>

      academic year. Each domain has its own Council which helps the Secretaries
      in conducting various activities throughout the year. Student Gymkhana is
      constituted to foster a sense of unity among the students. It oversees all
      the aspects of the students' life during their stay at IIT Hyderabad and
