      'There are a whole lot of things in this world of ours you haven't started wondering about yet.'-Roald Dahl \n
      Welcome to a bizarre universe filled with classic literature but with a few twists, where nothing is as it seems, and reality is only a fabrication of your mind.\n
      
      From the works of Kafka to Arundathi Roy, from Mordor to Lilliput, from the Wizard of (Z)oz to Don Quixote, you can experience all the literature you grew up with and discover more.\n
      
      Take a break from your daily life and visit us to get enthralled by the ingenious ways the classics can be reinvented.\n
      
      Presenting to you the 3rd Edition of IITH's annual literary fest, Zozimus: Through the Looking glass.`,
