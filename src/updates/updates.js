On Monday, 13th February, the club invites all literary enthusiasts to join them for a Blackout Poetry and Open Mic Session. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Blackout Poetry involves taking a page from an existing text, such as a newspaper or a novel, and blacking out unrequired words to create a new poem. The process encourages creativity and is a new way of looking at the written word. \
    There is also an opportunity for attendees to perform their own writing with the Open Mic Session. Whether you are a seasoned poet or just want to showcase your musings, this event promises to be an inclusive and encouraging space for all.',
